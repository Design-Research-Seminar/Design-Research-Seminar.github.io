Dr Dan Lockton - Design with Intent - 10/12 2020 
</h5>
<img SRC="images/p_dan-lockton.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px 5px 5px; width:30%" >

<p><b>Abstract</b><br/>
Design is increasingly about people’s behaviour, but this is often considered simplistically. Design with Intent aims to give practitioners a more nuanced approach to design and behaviour, working with people, people’s understanding, and the complexities of everyday human experience. It’s a collection of design patterns—and a design and research approach—for exploring the interactions between design and people’s behaviour, across products, services and environments, both digital and physical.

The Design with Intent toolkit card deck was originally released in 2010 (free download), and an updated and expanded Design with Intent book is in progress: please sign up for the newsletter to be kept updated!

Design with Intent is aimed particularly at socially and environmentally beneficial behaviour change. The patterns are drawn from a range of disciplines, and are phrased as provocations to enable use as both a workshop tool, and a guide for exploring the field.


<p><b>Biography</b><br/>

Dr Dan Lockton is an interaction designer and researcher. His work centers on people's interactions with technology and the designed world, and how that affects the way we think, act, and understand. Dan established the new Imaginaries Lab and was Chair of Design Studies in the School of Design from 2017–20. He is an elected member of the Design Research Society's International Advisory Council from 2020–2026.
<br/><br/>
Dan is also a Faculty Affiliate of the CMU Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, a visiting tutor in Innovation Design Engineering at the Royal College of Art, London, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He is a founding member of the Plurality University Network, a Paris-based international collective of designers, futurists, and science-fiction writers.
<br/><br/>
Dan is creator of the Design with Intent toolkit (Equifine, 2010)—which has been widely adopted by educators, researchers, designers and businesses worldwide—and New Metaphors: A Creative Toolkit for Generating Ideas and Reframing Problems (Imaginaries Lab, 2019). He is an editor of Living Labs: Design and Assessment of Sustainable Living (Springer, 2016); he led the editorial team for Creative Citizens’ Variety Pack: Inspiring Digital Ideas from Community Projects (RCA, 2014); is a co-author of Drawing Energy: Exploring Perceptions of the Invisible (RCA, 2015); and is author of Rebel Without Applause (Bookmarque, 2003), a history of the Reliant Motor Company.
<br/><br/>
He regularly publishes in international academic journals and at conferences, in design, HCI, and related fields, and has been a member of program and review committees for events including CHI, DIS, DRS, and EPIC. He is a regular reviewer for leading academic journals including ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction and the International Journal of Design, and has been a grant reviewer for funding bodies including the Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council, EU Horizon 2020 Future & Emerging Technologies Programme, RCUK Sustainable Society Network+, and Fond National de la Recherche (Luxembourg). He maintains an active engagement with professional interaction design practice through delivering keynotes and workshops at industry events around the world, including IxDA Interaction, UX London, UX Lisbon, and Interaction Latin America. Dan was a jury member for the IxDA Interaction Awards 2019 and is co-chair of the student design competition for ACM DIS 2020.

Dr Marc Teyssier - Anthropomorphic Devices - 17 decembre 2020 
</h5>
<img SRC="images/p_Marc-Teyssier.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px 5px 5px; width:30%" >

<p><b>Abstract</b><br/>
Skin-On Interfaces are sensitive skin-like input methods than can be added to existing devices to increase their capabilities.
When we interact with others, we use skin as interfaces. However the objects of mediated communication - such as the smartphone - still has a cold interface that doesn't allow natural interaction and input.
In this project, I wanted to make available the perfect human interface that is the skin for existing devices.


<p><b>Biography</b><br/>

Interaction designer and researcher, I develop creative hardware and software experiences that bring technology closer to human nature. I am currently postdoctoral researcher at Saarland University, I did my PHD thesis at Télécom Paris and HCI La Sorbonne. Get my Resume.

These days, I use critical design to question existing devices form factor and explore how communication can be mediated through anthropomorphic devices.

Dr Joanna Boehnert - Design with Intent
</h5>
<img SRC="images/p_joanna_boehnert.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px 5px 5px; width:30%" >

<p><b>Abstract</b><br/>
Despite accumulative social and technological innovation, the design industry continues to face significant obstacles when addressing issues of sustainability. Climate change and other systemic ecological problems demands shifts on an order of magnitude well beyond the trajectory of business-as-usual. I will argue that these complex problems require addressing the epistemological error in knowledge systems reproducing unsustainable designed worlds.

Ecological literacy is a basis for nature-inspired design. Ecologically engaged knowledge must inform design strategies across the psychological, the social and the environmental domains. With the expansive three ecologies perspective, interventions at the intersection of design and economics can enable systems transitions. This theoretical work informs a framing of the current epoch in ways that create a foundation for the creation of regenerative, distributed and redirected design economies.

<p><b>Biography</b><br/>

I completed an AHRC-funded PhD in Design at the University of Brighton in 2012. I gained an MA from the University of Arts London and a BA Honours with distinction at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.
<br/><br/>
I founded EcoLabs in London in 2006 as a design research studio engaged with the visual communication of complex environmental problems. Three years later, my PhD research proposal describing why the design industry needed ecologically literate design theory was awarded AHRC funding. I completed a doctorate titled The Visual Communication of Ecological Literacy: Designing, Learning and Emergent Ecological Perception under the supervision of Professor of Sustainable Design Jonathan Chapman and Professor of Media Studies Julie Doyle.
<br/><br/>
Post-PhD, I conducted a practice-based research project called ‘Mapping Climate Communication’ during a CIRES Visiting Fellowship at Center for Science and Technology Policy Research (CSTPR) in the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder. Next, I wrote my book Design, Ecology, Politics: Toward the Ecocene while working as a Research Fellow at the Centre for Research and Education in Arts and Media (CREAM) at the University of Westminster. Immediately before joining Loughborough University, I led a research project on the visual communication of complexity at the Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus (CECAN) at the University of Surrey.
<br/><br/>
As an environmental communication designer, I have worked in a variety of spaces in academia, the creative industries, publishing, and non-profit and activist organisations. I co-founded Transition Town Brixton (2007) and Occupy Design UK (2011) and have worked with many groups on issues of environmental and social justice. You can follow my latest activities on my academic Twitter account @ecocene and my personal blog.
